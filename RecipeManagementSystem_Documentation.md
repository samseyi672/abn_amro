# Recipe Management System Documentation

## Overview

The Recipe Management System is designed using a robust microservices architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and flexibility. The system comprises four core microservices, each responsible for a specific domain within the application ecosystem. This architecture allows each service to evolve independently while maintaining seamless integration.

## Microservices Architecture

The system consists of the following microservices:

1. **API Gateway**
    - Handles request routing from clients to the appropriate microservices.
    - Provides client-side load balancing for optimal performance and reliability.

2. **Service Discovery**
    - Monitors the health and availability of each microservice instance.
    - Facilitates dynamic registration and deregistration of services, enabling robust failover and scaling.

3. **User Management**
    - Manages user registration, authentication, and user profile operations.
    - Ensures secure onboarding and management of users.

4. **Recipe Management**
    - Responsible for all operations related to recipe creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion.
    - Acts as the core business service for managing recipes.

## System Artifacts

- **Architecture Diagram:** A visual representation of the system architecture is provided in the project artifacts, illustrating the interaction and flow between the microservices.
- **API Documentation:** 
    - Comprehensive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation is available for both the User Management and Recipe Management microservices.
    - These documents detail sample requests and responses, enabling easy integration and testing.

## Deployment and Containerization

The system leverages Docker Compose for container orchestration, providing two distinct deployment configurations:

1. **Full Observability and Monitoring Deployment**
    - Includes monitoring and observability tools.
    - This deployment consumes more system memory and is recommended for production environments or deep diagnostics.

2. **Core Microservices Deployment**
    - Spins up only the four essential microservices along with their corresponding databases.
    - Offers a lightweight setup suitable for development and testing environments.

### Running the Services

Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed on your machine.

1. **Start the Services:**
    ```bash
    docker compose up
    ```

2. **Stop the Services:**
    ```bash
    docker compose down
    ```

> **Note:** Use the second (internal) Docker Compose file for a lightweight deployment that excludes observability and monitoring components.
